# 75 Days of DSA Grind – Day 10 🚀  

## 🧠 Topics Covered  
1. **Move Zeros to the End**  
2. **Max Consecutive Ones**  

---

## 📚 Overview  
Day 10 focused on **array manipulation problems** from LeetCode. Both problems helped strengthen **array traversal, in-place operations, and logic building**. Today was about **learning efficiently and practicing problem-solving with real examples**.

## 🧩 Problem Breakdown  

### 🔹 Move Zeros to the End  
**Problem:** Move all `0`s to the end of an array while maintaining the order of non-zero elements.  
- Input: `[0,1,0,3,12]`  
- Output: `[1,3,12,0,0]`  
**Approach:**  
- Use **two-pointer method**:  
  - One pointer to track the position to place non-zero numbers.  
  - Iterate through the array, moving non-zero numbers forward.  
  - Fill remaining positions with `0`.  
- Focused on **in-place operations** to avoid extra memory usage.  

### 🔹 Max Consecutive Ones  
**Problem:** Find the maximum number of consecutive `1`s in a binary array.  
- Input: `[1,1,0,1,1]`  
- Output: `2`  
**Approach:**  
- Initialize a **counter for consecutive ones**.  
- Traverse the array:  
  - If `1`, increment counter.  
  - If `0`, reset counter and update max value.  
- Practiced **loop-based counting** and **conditional tracking**.

## 🌱 Key Learnings  
- Two-pointer technique is **very useful for in-place array operations**.  
- Counting logic in arrays builds foundation for **pattern-based or numeric problems**.  
- Small problems like these **boost problem-solving confidence**.  
- Handling edge cases: arrays with all zeros, single element arrays, or no ones.

## 💭 Reflection  
Day 10 reinforced the importance of **practice and patience**. Solving two problems may take time, but **each solution teaches multiple lessons** — from array manipulation to efficient logic building. Consistency is key in the DSA journey.
