# 📘 Day 09 — Merge Sorted Array

### 🧠 Today’s Learning
- Focused on a single problem: **Merge Sorted Array**
- Initially, I thought I’d cover **2 topics**, but this one took **more time to deeply understand**
- It’s okay — some concepts need more time, and I’m ready to face them 💪
- The main goal is **understanding, not rushing**

### 💡 Concept Summary
- Given two sorted arrays, merge them into one sorted array.
- Keep order without using built-in sort.
- Example:  
  `nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0]`, `m = 3`  
  `nums2 = [2,5,6]`, `n = 3`  
  ✅ Output → `[1,2,2,3,5,6]`

### 🧩 Key Takeaways
- Learn to handle array merging logic carefully.
- Improved patience while debugging.
- Realized that **progress is not about speed but depth**.

### 🚀 Reflection
> “It’s fine if some days take longer — learning isn’t a race; it’s consistency that wins.”
