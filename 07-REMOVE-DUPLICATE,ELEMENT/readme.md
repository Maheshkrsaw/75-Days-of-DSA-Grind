# 75 Days of DSA Grind – Day 07 🚀  

## 🧠 Topic: Remove Duplicates & Unique Elements in Arrays  

---

## 📚 Overview  
Day 07 focused on **array manipulation** to remove duplicates and extract **unique elements**. This exercise strengthens understanding of loops, conditions, and JS data structures while improving problem-solving skills for real-world DSA challenges.  

---

## 🧩 Concepts Covered  
- Identifying **duplicate elements** in an array  
- Removing duplicates to create a **unique elements array**  
- Maintaining **original order** while filtering  
- Understanding the difference between **mutating the original array** and creating a **new array**  

---

## 💡 Approach & Problem-Solving Strategy  
1. Scan the array sequentially.  
2. Check if an element is **already added** to the unique collection.  
3. If not present, include it in the result array.  
4. For JS, `Set` or `filter` methods can simplify the process.  
5. Validate with **edge cases**: empty array, all duplicates, single element.  

---

## 🌱 Key Learnings  
- Array deduplication is a **common DSA and interview problem**.  
- Using `Set` or `filter` improves **code readability and efficiency**.  
- Maintaining order while removing duplicates requires careful iteration.  
- Understanding this logic helps in **data cleaning, preparation, and optimization** tasks.

## 🏁 Reflection  
Day 07 was about **cleaning and refining data in arrays**. Removing duplicates is simple but teaches **attention to detail and efficient array handling**, which is crucial for **coding interviews and real-world applications**.
