 # 75 Days of DSA Grind – Day 08 🚀  

## 🧠 Topics Covered  
- Reverse a String 🔁  
- Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock 📈  

---

## 📚 Overview  
Day 08 focused on **string manipulation** and **array-based algorithmic problems**.  
I successfully practiced **reversing strings** and attempted the **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock** problem.  

---

## 🧩 Problem Breakdown  

### 🔹 Reverse a String  
- Practiced using **loops** and **built-in JS methods**.  
- Reversed both **entire strings** and **individual words** to understand different approaches.  
- Developed a clean approach to **iterate backward or use array methods**.  

### 🔹 Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock  
- Tried to track **minimum price** and **maximum profit**.  
- Conceptually understood the problem but found the **logic confusing**.  
- Decided to **pause this problem** and revisit later for better understanding.

## 🌱 Key Learnings  
- Small wins like **string reversal** build confidence for tougher problems.  
- It's okay to **move on from challenging problems** and return with fresh perspective.  
- Focus on **progress, not perfection** — consistency matters more.
