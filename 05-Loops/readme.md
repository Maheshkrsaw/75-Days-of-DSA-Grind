# Day 122 – Loops in Java

## Concepts Covered:
- **Loop Basics**: Repetition of tasks to reduce code redundancy
- **while Loop**: Executes as long as the condition is true  
    - Print numbers 1 to 10  
    - Print numbers 1 to N  
    - Sum of first N natural numbers
- **for Loop**: Ideal for known iterations  
    - Print square patterns  
    - Print reverse of a number  
    - Reverse any given number
- **do-while Loop**: Executes at least once, then checks condition
- **Break Statement**: Exit loop early  
- **Continue Statement**: Skip current iteration and move to next
- **Prime Number Check**: Using loops and conditionals

## Steps Taken:
1. Practiced **while loops** for counting and summing ✅  
2. Implemented **for loops** for patterns and number reversal ✅  
3. Explored **do-while loop** for guaranteed execution ✅  
4. Learned **break and continue statements** with examples ✅  
5. Solved **prime number check** using loops ✅  

## Mindset & Learning:
- Loops simplify **repetitive tasks**  
- Choosing the right loop type avoids unnecessary complexity  
- Mastery of **break/continue** improves control flow  
- Prime checking reinforces **conditional + loop logic**
