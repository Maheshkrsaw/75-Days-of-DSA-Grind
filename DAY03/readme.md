# 75 Days of DSA Grind – Day 03 🚀💻  

**Topic:** Slowly But Progressing – Second Largest Number in Array  

## Overview 📝
Day 03 focused on **finding the second largest number in an array**. This problem is a step up from basic array operations and reinforces **loop logic and comparison patterns**.  

**Concepts Covered:**  
- Iterating through arrays with conditions  
- Maintaining multiple trackers (largest & second largest)  
- Handling edge cases: duplicates, all equal numbers  

## Approach & Problem-Solving Strategy 🧠
- Traverse the array once while updating **largest** and **second largest** values.  
- Dry-run examples to ensure logic correctness.  
- Focused on **clarity over speed**, emphasizing understanding of comparisons and iteration.  

## Tips & Best Practices 💡
- Always initialize tracking variables appropriately.  
- Test edge cases with small arrays to avoid mistakes.  
- Break the problem into **simple steps**: check → update → continue.  

## Reflection 🌱
Day 03 reinforced that **progress matters more than speed**. Successfully solving problems like this builds confidence and a **solid foundation for more complex DSA challenges**.
