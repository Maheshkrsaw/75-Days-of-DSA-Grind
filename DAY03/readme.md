# 75 Days of DSA Grind – Day 03 🚀💻  

**Topic:** Second Largest Number & Nested Loops  

## Overview 📝
Day 03 focused on improving **logical thinking using loops**. I worked on two key areas — finding the **second largest number** in an array and understanding **nested loops**, which are essential for pattern-based problems and time complexity understanding.  

**Concepts Covered:**  
- Logic to find the **second largest number** in an array.  
- Practicing **loop inside loop (nested loops)**.  
- Introduction to **pattern printing logic**.  
- Understanding **time complexity (O(n²))** when using nested loops.  

## Approach & Problem-Solving Strategy 🧠
- Divided the task into clear sub-steps: find the largest first, then identify the second largest.  
- Dry-run the loop logic on small examples to ensure correctness.  
- Explored nested loops with simple star pattern structures to visualize iteration flow.  
- Observed how **outer and inner loops** interact to form shapes and manage logic depth.  

## Tips & Best Practices 💡
- Be clear about **loop boundaries** to avoid off-by-one errors.  
- For the second largest problem — focus on **comparisons and variable updates** carefully.  
- Use nested loops regularly — they improve both **logic building** and **coding accuracy**.  
- Start slow with small patterns like triangles or squares to grasp loop flow.  

## Reflection 🌱
Day 03 was all about **steady growth**. Understanding nested loops built my foundation for upcoming pattern problems, while solving the second largest number improved my confidence in applying logic through iterations. Every step, no matter how small, moves me forward in the grind.
