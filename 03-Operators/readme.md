# Day 120 – Operators in Java

## Concepts Covered:
- **Types of Operators**:
    - **Arithmetic Operators**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
    - **Unary Operators**: `++`, `--`, `+`, `-`
    - **Relational Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
    - **Logical Operators**: `&&`, `||`, `!`
    - **Assignment Operators**: `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`  
- **Operator Precedence**: Rules that determine the order of operations

## Steps Taken:
1. Listed all types of operators in Java ✅  
2. Practiced each operator with simple examples ✅  
3. Tested relational and logical operators in conditions ✅  
4. Applied operator precedence in arithmetic and logical expressions ✅  

## Mindset & Learning:
- Operators are **fundamental to writing any Java program**  
- Understanding **precedence avoids bugs**  
- Practicing operators improves **problem-solving speed**  
- Reinforced the concept that **small fundamentals lead to strong coding skills**
