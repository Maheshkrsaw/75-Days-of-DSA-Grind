# 75 Days of DSA Grind – Day 12 & 13 🔁  

## 🧠 Overview  
Days 12 and 13 were dedicated to **revision mode** — a complete recap of everything learned from **Day 1 to Day 11**.  
Instead of rushing into new problems, I focused on **solidifying fundamentals**, identifying weak areas, and re-solving key problems to strengthen logic and confidence.

## 📚 Topics Revisited  

### **Core JS Fundamentals (Day 1–5 Recap)**  
- Variables (`let`, `var`, `const`) and Data Types  
- Loops (for, while) and If-Else Logic  
- Functions and Argument Handling  
- Arrays and Common Operations  
- Pattern Programming and Nested Loops  
- Number problems — Reverse, Palindrome, Digit Count  

### **Complexity & Efficiency (Day 6 Recap)**  
- Time and Space Complexity (O(1), O(n), O(n²), O(log n))  
- Big O Notation Understanding  
- Efficiency Comparison: Linear Search vs Binary Search  

### **Array Logic & Bit Manipulation (Day 7–11 Recap)**  
- Removing Duplicates & Filtering Unique Elements  
- Merge Sorted Arrays using Two-Pointer Technique  
- Move Zeros to End & Max Consecutive Ones  
- Missing Number (Sum Formula / XOR)  
- Single Number (XOR vs HashMap approach)  

---

## ⚙️ **Marked for Further Practice**  
1️⃣ **Merge Sorted Array** → Revisiting pointer logic & edge cases.  
2️⃣ **Single Number** → Strengthening XOR and frequency map concept.  

---

## 💭 **Reflection**  
- Realized the value of **revision in deep understanding**.  
- Strengthened logic for earlier topics — especially arrays and loops.  
- Understood that consistency beats speed — slow learning with clarity is better than fast confusion.  
- Confidence increased in bit manipulation and pattern-based logic.  

---

## 🌱 **Key Takeaways**  
- Revision helps bridge the gap between *knowing* and *understanding*.  
- Each topic connects — arrays, loops, and logic form the base for upcoming advanced DSA.  
- Practicing old problems gave new insights with a better approach.
