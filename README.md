# 75 Days of DSA Grind – Full Journey (Day 01 – Day 10) 🚀  

Welcome to the **75 Days of DSA Grind** repository!  
Here’s a concise summary of the first **10 days** of learning, covering fundamental JavaScript, loops, arrays, patterns, numbers, complexity, and LeetCode problem-solving.  

---

## 📌 Topics Covered (Day 01 – Day 10)  

### **Day 01 – Warm-up & JS Fundamentals**  
- Let, Var, Const, Data Types  
- Code execution line by line in JS  
- Arrays, If-Else, Loops (for, while)  
- Function arguments  

### **Day 02 – Array Basics & Practice**  
- Practice loop questions  
- Search an element in an array  
- Count negative numbers  
- Find largest number  

### **Day 03 – Nested Loops & Second Largest**  
- Find second largest number in an array  
- Loop in loop (nested loops) for pattern preparation  

### **Day 04 – Pattern Programming**  
- Square stars, triangles, number pyramids  
- Right-aligned stars, inverted numbers  
- Binary patterns (1-0 alternating)  

### **Day 05 – Number Logic**  
- Reverse a number  
- Check palindrome number  
- Count digits including negative numbers  

### **Day 06 – Time & Space Complexity**  
- Types of time complexity (O(1), O(n), O(n²), O(log n), etc.)  
- Big O notation & efficiency  
- Space complexity  
- Linear search & Binary search comparison  

### **Day 07 – Array Deduplication**  
- Remove duplicates and make elements unique  
- Example: `[3,1,3,4,3,3,3,7]` → `[1,4,7]`  
- Practiced array iteration, filtering, and Set usage  

### **Day 08 – String & Stock Problem**  
- Reverse a string  
- Attempted Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (concept unclear, revisited later)  

### **Day 09 – Merge Sorted Array**  
- Merge two sorted arrays efficiently using **two-pointer technique**  
- Focused on deep understanding instead of speed  

### **Day 10 – LeetCode Practice**  
- Move Zeros to the End: `[0,1,0,3,12]` → `[1,3,12,0,0]`  
- Max Consecutive Ones: `[1,1,0,1,1]` → `2`  
- Reinforced **two-pointer technique** and **counter logic**
