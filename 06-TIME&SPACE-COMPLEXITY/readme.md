# 75 Days of DSA Grind – Day 06 🚀  

## 🧠 Topic: Time Complexity & Searching Algorithms  

---

## 📚 Overview  
Day 06 focused on **analyzing algorithm efficiency** through time and space complexity.  
We explored **linear and binary search algorithms** and how to evaluate their performance using **Big O notation**.  

---

## 🧩 Concepts Covered  

### 1️⃣ Time Complexity  
- **Constant O(1):** Accessing a single element, simple arithmetic.  
- **Linear O(n):** Iterating through an array (linear search).  
- **Quadratic O(n²):** Nested loops (pattern printing, matrix operations).  
- **Logarithmic O(log n):** Binary search, divide-and-conquer approaches.  
- **Exponential O(2ⁿ) & Factorial O(n!):** Recursive combinatorial problems.  

### 2️⃣ Big O Notation  
- Expresses the **upper bound of algorithm operations** relative to input size.  
- Helps **compare efficiency** between different approaches.  

### 3️⃣ Space Complexity  
- Memory usage by variables, arrays, and recursion stacks.  
- Important to optimize **both time and memory** in large-scale problems.  

### 4️⃣ Searching Algorithms  
- **Linear Search:** Check each element sequentially → O(n)  
- **Binary Search:** Divide-and-conquer on sorted arrays → O(log n)

## 💡 Approach & Problem-Solving Strategy  
- Identify **input size** and **repeated operations**.  
- Analyze **loops, nested loops, and recursive calls**.  
- Practice **search problems** to see theory in action.  
- Compare **linear vs binary search** to understand practical efficiency gains.

## 🌱 Reflection  
Day 06 reinforced that **algorithm correctness alone is not enough**; understanding **how fast and efficient your solution is** is equally important.  
Time and space complexity knowledge builds the foundation for **writing optimized DSA solutions**.
