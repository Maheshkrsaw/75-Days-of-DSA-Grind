# 🚀 Day 04 — Pattern Programming  

Welcome to **Day 04** of my **#75DaysOfDSAGrind** challenge!  
Today's focus was on mastering **Pattern Programming** using **Nested Loops** — an essential foundation for logical thinking and control flow in programming.  

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered  
- Nested Loops (loop inside loop)  
- Relation between outer loop (rows) and inner loop (columns)  
- Understanding number and star-based patterns  
- Space handling for aligned shapes  
- Incremental and decremental logic

## 🧩 Key Learnings  
- Each **pattern’s shape = outer loop (rows) × inner loop (columns)**  
- **Spaces** are just as important as symbols in shaping output  
- Improved control over **loop conditions and nesting structure**  
- Understood **pattern symmetry and inverse logic**

---

## 🪄 Thought Process  
1. Drew each pattern on paper before coding  
2. Found logic for spaces and printed elements  
3. Built step-by-step from basic to complex patterns  
4. Verified output visually for alignment & correctness
