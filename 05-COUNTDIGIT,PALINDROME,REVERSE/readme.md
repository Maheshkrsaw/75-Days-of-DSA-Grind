# 75 Days of DSA Grind – Day 05 🚀  

## 🧠 Topics Covered  
- Reverse a Number 🔁  
- Palindrome Number Check 🔍  
- Count Number of Digits 🔢  
- Handling Negative Numbers ⚠️  

---

## 📚 Overview  
Day 05 was about strengthening number-based logic and understanding how digits interact through loops and mathematical operations. The exercises focused on **reversing**, **checking palindromes**, and **counting digits**, ensuring all **corner cases** (like negative numbers and zeros) were covered.

## 🧩 Problem-Solving Breakdown  

### 🔹 Reverse a Number  
- Extracted digits using the **modulus (%) operator**.  
- Reconstructed the number using **multiplication by 10** and **addition of remainder**.  
- Ensured negative numbers were handled by converting them to positive first, then restoring the sign.  

### 🔹 Palindrome Check  
- Reused the reverse logic to check if a number remains the same after reversing.  
- Compared the original number and the reversed number for equality.  
- Practiced with edge cases — single-digit, negative, and zero.  

### 🔹 Count Digits  
- Used a **while loop** to divide the number by 10 until it becomes 0.  
- Increased a counter for each iteration.  
- Added special conditions for zero (which has 1 digit).

## 💡 Key Insights  
- Always think about **edge cases** — negative numbers, zero, and single digits.  
- Modular arithmetic is a powerful tool in **digit manipulation** problems.  
- Loop-based digit extraction helps in understanding **data breakdown**.  
- These concepts act as a base for problems like **Armstrong, Strong, and Perfect Numbers**.

## 🌱 Reflection  
Day 05 gave me a deeper understanding of **numeric logic flow**.  
Learning to handle all edge cases increased my **confidence and accuracy** in coding.  
Small problems, but big lessons in **logical reasoning** and **attention to detail**! 💪
